# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! This project creates the rest of the tests.

#Running the app

Download the code by selecting 'Download ZIP'. Then simply open the frontend-nanodegree-feedreader folder, right click on index.html, and open in the browser of your choice. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will see all 7 specs and any failures in the Jasmine tests.
